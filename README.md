# firebase_setup_starting_point

This repo is intended to be a "starting point" for projects that use firebase and vue, so you can get the "boring" setup work out of the way before lecture.

How I generated this project:

1. `vue create firebase_setup_stating_point`
2. `vue add router`
    * I also edited the github file, which makes sense.
